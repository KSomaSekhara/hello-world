# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I started learning Github and I'm excited.

AI --> Eg: RPA. It can automate but it can't learn on its own or From with-in the data.
    ==> ML --> Machine which is learning from with-in the data. It has to be trained on regular basis to stay updated with the marker standards.
                 ==> DL --> Complex/Large data. It can solve complex quickly compared to ML. CNN/RNN/
                         ==> Gen-AI --> AI,ML,DL depends on the training data and generating the Output. But Gen-AI is to create a new content (data-sets). Create new written, visual and auditory  content given prompts or existing data.
